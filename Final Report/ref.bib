	abstract = {When two tones with slightly different frequencies are presented to both ears, they interact in the central auditory system and induce the sensation of a beating sound. At low difference frequencies, we perceive a single sound, which is moving across the head between the left and right ears. The percept changes to loudness fluctuation, roughness, and pitch with increasing beat rate. To examine the neural representations underlying these different perceptions, we recorded neuromagnetic cortical responses while participants listened to binaural beats at a continuously varying rate between 3 Hz and 60 Hz. Binaural beat responses were analyzed as neuromagnetic oscillations following the trajectory of the stimulus rate. Responses were largest in the 40-Hz gamma range and at low frequencies. Binaural beat responses at 3 Hz showed opposite polarity in the left and right auditory cortices. We suggest that this difference in polarity reflects the opponent neural population code for representing sound location. Binaural beats at any rate induced gamma oscillations. However, the responses were largest at 40-Hz stimulation. We propose that the neuromagnetic gamma oscillations reflect postsynaptic modulation that allows for precise timing of cortical neural firing. Systematic phase differences between bilateral responses suggest that separate sound representations of a sound object exist in the left and right auditory cortices. We conclude that binaural processing at the cortical level occurs with the same temporal acuity as monaural processing whereas the identification of sound location requires further interpretation and is limited by the rate of object representations.},

	abstract = {The ability to determine the location of a sound source is fundamental to hearing. However, auditory space is not represented in any systematic manner on the basilar membrane of the cochlea, the sensory surface of the receptor organ for hearing. Understanding the means by which sensitivity to spatial cues is computed in central neurons can therefore contribute to our understanding of the basic nature of complex neural representations. We review recent evidence concerning the nature of the neural representation of auditory space in the mammalian brain and elaborate on recent advances in the understanding of mammalian subcortical processing of auditory spatial cues that challenge the {\textquotedblleft}textbook{\textquotedblright} version of sound localization, in particular brain mechanisms contributing to binaural hearing.},

abstract ={The goal of this study was to determine the temporal response properties of different auditory cortical areas in humans. This is achieved by recording the phase-locked neural activity to white noises modulated sinusoidally in amplitude (AM) at frequencies between 4 and 128 Hz, in the left and right cortices of 20 subjects. Phase-locked neural responses are recorded in four auditory cortical areas with intracerebral electrodes, and modulation transfer functions (MTFs) are computed from these responses. A number of MTFs are bandpass in shape, demonstrating a selective encoding of AM frequencies below 64 Hz in the auditory cortex. This result provides strong physiological support to the idea that the human auditory system decomposes the temporal envelope of sounds (such as speech) into its constituting AM components. Moreover, the results show a predominant response of cortical auditory areas to the lowest AM frequencies (4?16 Hz). This range matches the range of AM frequencies crucial for speech intelligibility, emphasizing therefore the role played by these initial stations of cortical processing in the analysis of speech. Finally, the results show differences in AM sensitivity across cortical areas and hemispheres, and provide a physiological foundation for claims of functional specialization of auditory areas based on previous population measures.},

	abstract = {Magnetoencephalographic responses to 40-Hz amplitude-modulated tones of 4-s duration were recorded in young, middle-aged, and older healthy participants. Interaural phase difference (IPD) in the sound carrier was changed during stimulus presentation from 0 to 180{\textdegree}, resulting in perceptual change from focal to spacious sound. The stimulus modulation elicited synchronized gamma-band oscillations, the 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Equivalent current dipoles were localized in primary auditory cortices. Waveforms of cortical activity showed a decrement in ASSR amplitude 100 ms after stimulus IPD change and modification of ASSR phase, which was maximally 90{\textdegree}, corresponding to 6-ms delay. Time courses of ASSR phase deviation constituted a novel auditory response. The amount of ASSR phase change decreased with increasing stimulus frequency and revealed upper limits for physiological IPD detection. Thresholds for IPD detection were found close to 1,500 Hz in the young, around 1,250 Hz in the middle-aged group, and around 1,000 Hz in the older group. Whereas the ASSR change response revealed aging-related decline of binaural hearing, the amplitude of 40-Hz response and the size of the ASSR change response were not affected by aging. Additional ASSR change responses were recorded at a high rate of stimulus changes every 400 ms. ASSR response detection at this rate was superior to response detection based on the auditory-evoked P1{\textendash}N1{\textendash}P2 response. Responses to changes from focal to spacious sound were larger than those in the reverse direction. The ASSRs were interpreted in relation to oscillatory gamma-band activity representing auditory object representation.},
